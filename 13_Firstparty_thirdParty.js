// "First-party vs Third-party cookies ðŸ”¥"

// A cookie is a small text file that a website stores on a user's computer or device to remember
// user preferences and login information. Cookies are categorized into
// two types: first-party and third-party cookies.

// First-party cookies:
// First-party cookies are created by the website that the user is currently visiting,
// and can be accessed by JavaScript code running on that same website. They are typically used to
// store user preferences, login information, and other session-related data. First-party cookies are
// generally considered more secure and trustworthy than third-party cookies because they are created
// by the website that the user is interacting with directly.

// Third-party cookies:
// Third-party cookies, on the other hand, are created by domains other than the one the user is currently
// visiting, and can be accessed by JavaScript code running on those other domains. They are often used
// for tracking user behavior across multiple websites and are considered more invasive and potentially
// privacy-infringing. Third-party cookies are often used by advertisers and analytics companies
// to collect data about users' browsing habits and serve targeted ads.

// As a general rule, you should use first-party cookies when you need to store session-related data
// for your own website, such as user preferences or login information. You should use third-party
// cookies sparingly and only for legitimate reasons, such as for analytics or advertising purposes
// that are clearly disclosed to users and provide them with a clear option to opt out.

// It's worth noting that in recent years, many browsers have begun phasing out support for third-party
// cookies, due in part to concerns about user privacy. Therefore, it's increasingly important to rely
// on first-party cookies and other privacy-preserving techniques when building web applications.
